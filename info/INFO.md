Define Grammar: Determine the grammar of the language you are parsing. This usually involves specifying the syntactic rules that define valid structures in your language.

Parsing Technique: Decide on a parsing technique. Common approaches include top-down parsing (like recursive descent parsing) and bottom-up parsing (like LR parsers).

Parse Tree: Write code to construct a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens provided by the lexer. This tree represents the syntactic structure of the source code.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage syntax errors effectively, providing meaningful feedback.

Integration with Lexer: Ensure that the parser correctly interfaces with the lexer to receive tokens.

This implementation would require a good understanding of formal language theory and parsing algorithms. You would typically use data structures like trees for representing the parsed structure and algorithms for traversing and interpreting these structures.

Grammar Specification: What is the specific grammar of the language you are designing the parser for? Have you defined it formally?

Parsing Strategy: Have you chosen a specific parsing strategy (like recursive descent, LL, LR, etc.)? What influenced this choice?

Error Handling: How do you plan to handle syntax errors in the parser? What kind of feedback will you provide to the user?

Integration with Lexer: How is your parser going to interact with the lexer? Have you defined a protocol or interface for this interaction?

AST Design: How will you represent the abstract syntax tree (AST)? Have you decided on the structure and nodes of the AST?

Semantic Analysis: Do you plan to integrate semantic analysis in the parsing phase or handle it separately?

Testing and Validation: What is your plan for testing the parser? Do you have sample code or test cases prepared?

Language Grammar: The lexer identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators. How do these elements combine in your language's grammar? What are the rules for valid expressions and statements?

Parser Implementation: Given your lexer's structure, what parsing approach would best suit your language? Are you considering a recursive descent parser, which is often easier to implement for simpler grammars?

Error Handling in Parser: How will your parser handle syntax errors? For example, what happens if an expression is incomplete or a parenthesis is unmatched?

AST Structure: Based on your lexer tokens, what will the nodes in your Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) look like? How will you represent different constructs like expressions, statements, and function declarations?

Integration with Lexer: How will the parser interface with the lexer? Will it request tokens one by one, or will it work on a set of tokens generated in advance?

Semantic Checks: Will your parser perform any semantic checks (like variable scope resolution), or will this be handled in a separate phase?

Combining Elements in Language Grammar: This question asks about how the basic elements identified by your lexer (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators) form larger constructs in your programming language. For example, how do these elements combine to form valid expressions (like arithmetic expressions), statements (like if-statements), or function declarations? It's about defining the syntax rules of your language.

AST Nodes Based on Lexer Tokens: This question pertains to how you'll structure the nodes in your Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the syntactic structure of your language. For instance, an expression node might contain child nodes for operands and operators, a statement node might represent a complete statement, and a function declaration node could contain nodes for the function's name, parameters, and body. The design of these nodes will be based on the tokens your lexer generates.

Expressions: How are arithmetic and logical expressions formed? For example, are they infix (e.g., a + b), prefix (e.g., + a b), or postfix (e.g., a b +)? What operators are allowed, and what are their precedence rules?

Statements: What constitutes a valid statement in your language? For example, how are conditional statements like if-else structured? Are there loop constructs, and how are they defined?

Function Declarations: How are functions declared? What is the syntax for defining function names, parameters, and bodies?

For AST Nodes:

Expression Nodes: How will you represent different types of expressions in the AST? Will you have separate nodes for arithmetic operations, logical operations, etc.?

Statement Nodes: What will the structure for a statement node look like? Will there be different nodes for different types of statements (like if, while, return)?

Function Nodes: How will a function declaration be represented in the AST? Will it include child nodes for parameters, return types, and function bodies?

Expression Parsing: Since your language uses infix expressions, your parser will need to handle binary operators with appropriate precedence and associativity. It should correctly parse expressions like a + b and a * (b + c).

Statement Parsing: You've outlined if-else and for loop constructs. Your parser should recognize these structures, ensuring the correct parsing of conditions and action blocks. For example, it needs to correctly parse and differentiate between if <condition> { actions } else { actions } and for (initial; increment; action_for_each_iteration) { actions }.

Function Declaration Parsing: Your function syntax follows a specific pattern, as in function add(a, b) if a > b a else b. The parser should recognize this pattern and parse function names, parameters, and bodies accordingly.

For AST Nodes:

Expression Nodes: Nodes for expressions would represent arithmetic and logical operations. You'll need nodes that can represent binary operations and handle their precedence.

Statement Nodes: Nodes for statements should capture the structure of if-else and for loops, including their condition, initialization, increment, and action blocks.

Function Nodes: A function node should encapsulate the function name, parameters, and its body, which could be an expression or a series of statements.
