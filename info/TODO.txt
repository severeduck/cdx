** TODO **

[] Lexer (Lexical Analyzer): Breaks down the source code into tokens.

[] Parser (Syntax Analyzer): Constructs a syntax tree from the tokens, checking the syntactic structure.

[] Semantic Analyzer: Validates semantic consistency, like type checking and variable usage.

[] Intermediate Code Generator: Transforms the syntax tree into an intermediate code.

[] Optimizer: Improves the intermediate code for performance without altering its functionality.

[] Code Generator: Converts the optimized intermediate code into target machine code.

[] Symbol Table: Stores information about identifiers (like variables, functions).

[] Error Handler: Manages and reports errors throughout all stages.
