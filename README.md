# CDX Compiler

## Overview
Welcome to the CDX Compiler! 
This is a Rust-based compiler that's all about making text processing and pattern matching efficient and reliable. It's currently at version 0.1.0.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you get started, you'll need:
- The Rust programming language.
- Cargo, which is Rust's package manager.

### Installation
Here's how you can get up and running:
1. Clone our repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/severeduck/cdx.git
   ```
2. Jump into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cdx_compiler
   ```
3. Let's build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
   This step compiles everything and gets it ready for action.

## Usage
Ready to use the CDX Compiler? 
Simply run the compiled binary with the necessary arguments. 
Check out the documentation or examples in the project for more detailed instructions on getting started.

### Building from Source
If you're interested in building the compiler straight from the source, here's how:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
Your fresh executable will be waiting for you in `target/release`.

### Running Tests
Want to run our test suite? Just execute:
```bash
cargo test
```
It's always good to make sure everything is ticking along nicely!

## Development
If you're keen to dive into development, the `src` directory is your go-to place to understand the nuts and bolts of the CDX Compiler. 
You'll find additional guidelines and standards for development in our project documentation.
